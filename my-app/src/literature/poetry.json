                "After many a weeks' share of academic and interpersonal troubles, I decided to go for a walk in the park at an hour close to midnight. Whist strolling, the overdue realisation that I now dwell in a land I was unprepared to call home came as gently as the breeze.",
                "",
                "I laid myself down on a bench half-shaded by a tree half-bare, and looked up. The night sky here was unobstructed by the local skyscrapers I was and still am amazed by, but that night, the nakedness of it all brought me relief.",
                "",
                "For the first time since arriving in Hong Kong, I saw, embraced, and sought solace in the stars. Blame the terrible light pollution, my eyes, or my ignorance, but the stars finally shone that night."
            ],
            "explanation": [
                "The distinction between the stars of \"this land\" and the stars at home symbolises my perception of life here as being separate and detached from the life I led at my far away home.",
                "\"Shaky hand\" here symbolises my weariness as a result of an exaggerated aging process, and the troubles that plagued me",
                "The repetition here pivots the intended audience of the following lines to the stars, and emphasises my acknowledgement of them",
                "\"Deteriorating\" here symbolises yet another symptom of aging, and the asking of forgiveness from the inanimate stars symbolise reverence and gratitude towards them",
                "The homonym \"missing\" here symbolise my failure to find the stars till now (due to my ignorance), and my longing for them; \"moonlight\" here symbolise the obvious (my goals, troubles, etc.) that have been at the centre of my attention",
                "The present"
            ],
            "personal": ["Stars are the simple yet valid thoughts and feelings that I have postponed for far too long (such as my homesickness), in favour of the more pressing and immediate concerns - the moon. It was a pleasant respite, when I acknowledged that my most pressing concerns are but a fragment of my necessary thoughts, and that time and attention should be given to them proportionately."]
